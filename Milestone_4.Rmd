#I cleaned letterwinners data and then filtered to exclude NA values in
#concentration and industry columns. I then mutated the concentration column
#with names of concentrations and the industry column with names of industries,
#so as to create a gt table, just for my own organization. I decided to make a
#bar chart because I didn't know how to graph two categorical variables, but I
#think it actually makes sense because you can see how many alums concentrated
#in which fields, and which indistries they are in now, which is the goal I had
#originally. When I originally created the chart, I had the concentrations were
#on the x-axis, but the titles made the axis crowded, so I used coord_flip flip
#them. 
#I still need to create more of the data and figure out which variables I
#want to use to merge the two data sets. At the end, I want a dataset with
#names, grad years, concentrations and secondary concentrations, locations,
#employers, positions, linkedins, and possibly former employers.
